# Font Compare

A local, web-based tool to compare two fonts visually and inspect their metadata. Built with Vite and opentype.js.

## Features

-   **Visual Comparison**:
    -   **Overlay Mode**: Overlap two fonts to spot subtle differences.
    -   **Side-by-Side Mode**: Compare fonts adjacent to each other.
-   **Variable Font Support**: Automatically detects variable axes (Weight, Slant, etc.) and provides sliders for real-time adjustment.
-   **Metadata Inspection**: View font family, style, glyph count, and format.
-   **Privacy Focused**: All font processing happens locally in your browser. No files are uploaded to any server.
-   **Premium Design**: Dark mode interface with glassmorphism aesthetics.
